- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rizz
- ðŸ˜‰ Definitely interested in you if you like talking about puzzles or philosophy.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code when high.
- Looking to team up and build cool stuff that blows minds.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - just email me/text me on X/by luck, maybe? 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can debug a server crash while dancing to my favorite playlist and sipping coffee â€” pure controlled chaos at its finest!
